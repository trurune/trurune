			<h1>The Raspberry Pi CM5 Development Kit</h1>

			<p>In the modern world, I understand that as a company RPI isn't very popular at the moment, due to their soaring prices that are a little bit undeserving. But I have to say, this looks like a pretty cool device.</p>
			<p>It's got a built in M.2 slot on the internals as well, which is very handy as the HATs for those can be a little bit rubbish depending on who you get it from</p>
			<p>I have heard some complaints about the heatsink being too large for the fan, which I have to say, is absolutely insane and does need to be fixed, I'm honestly pretty surprised that got let through QA, pretty astonishing really. Really hoping on a revision to fix that by the time I get one, but heatsinks aren't too expensive anyways, I can always get a slimmer one.</p>
			<p>Other than that it looks really sleek and definitely a good stocking filler for anyone into technology this upcoming Christmas</p>
			<p>I will be making an effort to get my hands on one, but i'm unsure when I will be able to, when I do, expect lots of content about it on here.</p>
